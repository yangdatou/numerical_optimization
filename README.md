# Numerical Optimization
An implementation of the basic optimization algorithms in Julia, based on [Dr. Qiang Zhu's course](http://www.physics.unlv.edu/~qzhu/num_opt.html) in summer 2020 (June-August, 10 weeks) through webex.

The course mostly followed the book of [Algorithms for Optimization by Mykel J. Kochenderfer and Tim A. Wheeler](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/algorithms-optimization).
Here is an intersting [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofWy5kaZU3g) by one of the authors talking about how they wrote the book in a recent Julia confernece.

For some details on the optimization algorithms, we will refer to [Numerical Optimization by Jorge Nocedal and Stephen J. Wright](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-40065-5)
